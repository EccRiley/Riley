Title: Riley: A working R-library of functions, data, color palettes (etc.) for everyday, and not-so-everyday, R tasks. This is primarily a'catch-all' repository of functions, data, and color palettes that I intend to include in one or more 'formal' R libraries (i.e., fully documented and subsequently published on CRAN).
Version: 0.1.1.9000

Description: This is primarily an R-package built for personal reasons and is in the very early stages in terms of package development. I am primarily building this package as my personal starting point for learning the ins-and-outs of R-package development.
