I am primarily building this package as my personal starting point for learning the ins-and-outs of `R-package` development and version control with `Git`. However, in the interest of code-sharing and knowledge generation, I am making the development process public via this `Github` repository.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the functions and objects available in **`Riley/R/`** are those that either I have written from scratch or those written by others which I have subsequently modified. Original source information regarding the latter category of functions is primarily only available in the source-code contained in \"_`Riley/R/SETUP.R`_\". The contents of the **`Riley/man/`** folder is severely lacking Rdocumentation files, which I am currently in the process of writing for each of the available functions in **`Riley/R/`**. \r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n# [Installation](#install)\r\n\r\nBecause the collective contents of this `R-package` remains a fledgling work in progess, _installation of `Riley` is not currently recommended_ unless you are working with the primary author (@EccRiley) or are in need of one or more of `Riley`'s currently available functions and do not wish to re-write them yourself at the moment. \r\n\r\n```{r eval=FALSE}\r\nif (!require('devtools')) install.packages('devtools'); require('devtools')\r\ndevtools::install_github('EccRiley/Riley')\r\n```\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n## [Package Updates and News](#updates)\r\n\r\nAny major updates to the package (i.e., changes that would prompt a revision to the [above](#install) anti-installation warning) will be immediately reflected in this _`README.md`_ document. However, in anticipation of frequent and abundant changes to the `Riley` in the near future, smaller updates will be recorded in [_`NEWS.md`_](NEWS.md).\r\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n# [`To-Do`](#todo)\r\n\r\n- [x] Initial package build\r\n- [ ] `LICENSE` file\r\n- [ ] `DESCRIPTION` file\r\n- [ ] Complete `RDocumentation` of package contents\r\n    - [ ] With source credits where appropriate\r\n",
